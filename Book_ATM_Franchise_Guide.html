                        <br><br>This book will also tell you about running the ATM business without spending on the insurance of Cash or without taking any risk of Cash Management for ATM.
                        <br><br>This book will tell you how you will have an ATM as your asset that will work 24x7 to earn for you for every transaction.
                        <br><br> It is all about earning a commission for every transaction that happens in ATM. Today, if you have an ATM card issued by ‚ÄúABC Bank‚Äù, you can use it in ‚ÄúXYZ Bank ATM‚Äù.  All because of the agreement between all the banks under the Payment and Settlement Act. By using other bank ATMs for Free, you not only save money but also save valuable time.  
                        <br><br>However, whenever you do any transaction in other Bank ATMs, your Card Issuing Bank pays a fee to the bank whose ATM you used, irrespective to it is being a free transaction or a paid transaction for you.
                        <br><br>No doubt, the usage of ATMs in India has gone up considerably over the last decade.
                        <br><br>However, India has around 250,000 ATMs as of March 2021, which means 1 ATM for 5000 people, or you can say it is just 22 ATMs per 100,000 people and is very low compared to other countries like Canada 214, Australia 146, Japan 124 ATMs or China 95 per 100,000 people.
                        <br><br>If we look at the population of India versus the number of ATMs, it is low. The ATMs are also not deployed evenly across rural and urban areas. Most of the ATMs are installed in metros or semi-metros. 
                        <br><br>If we want to match the install base of ATMs with China's install base, where they have 95 ATMs per 100,000 people, then we need a total of 11,87,000 ATMs against the current 250,000 ATMs.
                        <br><br>There is a requirement for ATM deployment in India to make it accessible to the masses and make it even more available in semi-urban & rural areas where it is highly underserved. 
                        <br><br>Considering the need for ATMs in India, especially for Tire 2 to 4 locations of the country, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a license to few non-banking entities to install and operate ATMs in their brand, which are called White Label ATMs. The White Label ATM holds the Brand Logo of the concerned White Label ATM Operator (WLA Operator), who own and operate ATMs in India.
                        Technically there is no difference, the same ATM manufacturer, the same VSAT Supplier, the same UPS Supplier, the same Cash Loading Agency, and the same Switching Provider. But the only difference is the routing of the transactions at the backend and the license to display own signage and branding by the WLA Operator.
                        Use of these White Label ATM is FREE. It does not charge anything extra or surcharge from Bank Customers for using these ATMs.  Only your Cash Issuing Bank can charge you after the monthly free transaction limit. 
                        <br><br>White Label ATMs always works like other Bank ATMs. You may use these White Label ATMs, it may be a Free transaction up to the monthly limit, or it may be a chargeable transaction for you (after free monthly limits). But whenever you use these White Label ATMs, your Card Issuing Bank pays a Fixed Fee per transaction to WLA Operator, per Cash Withdrawals and Non-Financial Transactions. These fees are called Interchange.  This book will tell you how you will earn a share of the interchange fee by joining the ATM Franchise Program.
                        Anyone with business acumen to start a business with Automated Teller Machine can read this book. However, the ATM business may not suit all. So read and understand before getting into spending or investing in the ATM franchise business. 
                        <br><br>It sounds interesting when we come to know about earning a passive income. At the same time, you must consider every prospect serious and analyse whether it suits you or not. 
                        <br><br>Like the success of any other business with similar investment and space, the ATM franchise business also depends on certain factors. These factors may vary. However, the common factors that impact the profitability of the ATM franchise business are - the visibility of the location, the footfall in the area, the cardholder base, the availability of electricity, the network connectivity, and the service quality provided by the service provider.
                        This book does not guarantee success in the ATM business. But if you want an insight into how the ATM franchise business works and how you can make a passive income by owning and operating the franchise of ATM, this will surely guide you. 
                        <br><br>Most people do not want to get into the detail of the business they want to start. They do not like to learn the risk involved. If you are among them, then this is of no use for you.
                        <br><br>Sometimes you will be approached by some broker or agent who will give you a sales speech to sell the franchise of ATM. But if you ask the ATM Operator a set of questions, you may not get the proper reply from them.  But as an investor, you must learn all the aspects of the business before getting into investing. You shall ask questions and, the franchisor must answer all your queries until you are satisfied fully. But, unfortunately, there are limited resources available over the internet that can solve your enquiries. That is why this book is.
                        <br><br>This book considers the interest of investors and readers so that all the queries related to ATM business answered.  There is no rocket science behind starting an ATM business, but there are few common factors, pros and cons of the ATM business which you must need to understand before getting into this business.

                        <h3>Chapter 1: Why you need ATM?</h3>
                        <p>
                            <br>If you need cash, you need an ATM. ATM is one of the preferred and secured alternate channels for carrying out banking transactions. 60% of cardholders prefer to use ATMs at least once or twice a week.
                            <br><br>Saving Bank Accountholders does at least 5-8 monthly transactions through ATM. If we look at the install base and the geography of India, the install base of ATMs is less compared to other countries, and on the other hand, existing ATMs are also not logically installed. 
                            <br><br>People want convenience and easy access to their Cash. Having an ATM in your business is a convenience that you can provide to your customers. ATM in your business will not only generate commission income but also will drive more traffic. It will also enhance sales and grow the revenue of your business.
                            <br><br>Adding an ATM to your business will not only increase foot traffic but, if you own the location, it will increase the value of the property too over some time.  
                            <br><br>Those people who will come to withdraw money from your ATM will look for the products you sell in your shop. When people have cash in their hands, they will surely buy what they wanted to buy a few days later. You can easily convert ATM Users to your regular customers.

                            <br><br>India has around 22 ATMs for 100,000 People, which is very low considering India‚Äôs population compared to other developed countries. In another way, the current ATM install base in India is around 250,000+ as of March 2021 and is continuously increasing. Though, if we look at the population versus install base, it is still low. If we compare India‚Äôs population of 130 Crore,  we will find that India has only 1 ATM for 5000 people.
                            <br><br><h3>GROWTH OF ATM:</h3>

                            <br><br>Look at the growth rate. There is no doubt that the Install base of ATM is growing very fast in India and has a potential marketing today due to the changes and initiatives in the Financial Inclusion by the Govt. of India in recent years. 

                            <br><br>Until 2007 there were hardly 35,000 ATMs, but from 2008, most of the private players got in the deployment of ATMs in an outsourced model, where banks started outsourcing ATM deployment to independent ATM deployers in India. Bank used to pay either a fixed fee per transaction or a monthly fixed monthly payment to the ATM deployers. This model is called brown-level. Currently, there are around 2,50,000 ATMs in India, including the bank deployed, brown-level, and white label ATMs.
                            <br><br>On average, 1400 to 1800 ATMs are being installed every month in India, excluding the current pandemic situation, which will impact the total growth. Still, there is a need for more ATMs in really required locations in Tire 3 to 6 Centers in India.
                            <br><br>There are many such locations where the ATM penetration is low, for example, Tea Gardens in the North East region where people covered under financial inclusion, and they have given ATM Cards.  However, the bank where they hold the account may not have branches in every tea estate. Most of the locations managed through the Business Correspondents are retail agents engaged by banks for providing banking services at locations. But hardly you will find an ATM there in every tea estate.
                            <br><br> In such locations, Automated Teller Machine plays a vital role. The general public considers ATM as a money dispenser only, whereas, ATM is a full-fledged automated technology, which can even replace a bank branch and work as a virtual bank branch.  ATM can not only dispense cash, but it can also accept cash deposits with instant credit to your bank account.
                            <br><br>By the name Automated Teller Machine, you will understand that it is an automated machine that works as a teller and can replace any human teller of a bank. A full-fledged ATM can perform all the tasks as a human teller, more cost-effectively 24x7, without any break.
                            <br><br>As far as the growth of ATMs is concerned, there is a need for re-balancing. Because, in metros, you will find many ATMs within one kilometre, whereas in villages you will have to walk 10 Km or more to find an ATM that too if it works.  
                            <br><br>There is potential in semi-urban and rural areas of India for ATMs. Only issuing cards to cardholders is not enough cardholders must start using those cards to move ahead towards this digital age. ATM is the first step towards that move.
                            <br><br>If you live in a society where people are even now dependant on Bank Branches, and accessing Bank Branches 2-3 times a month for withdrawing money for monthly needs if people have not yet opened their Bank Account. There is a  necessity for an ATM in such a society.

                        <h3>Chapter 8: Accountability</h3>
                        <p>
                        <br>When you buy a franchise of an ATM, you are the owner of the franchise. But the business model I am referring to here gives you an additional benefit of owning an ATM franchise but not buying the ATM or other equipment. Sounds good, right?
                        <br><br>What you need is to check with the ATM Operator that if they are selling the ATM to you, or just making you accountable for the location. If they ask you to buy the ATM, you must think about what will happen after the expiry of the franchise agreement. Will the ATM operator buy back the machine?
                        <br><br>The best model I recommend is not to buy ATM or any other assets. Let the ATM Operator own those assets, and you being a franchisee focus on the profitability of the location. If you buy the ATM, then you will be responsible for its insurance and its depreciation too. Obviously, after a few years, what will you do with that old machine, it is not a refrigerator or a computer that after the expiry of the franchise agreement you will use for a different purpose or keep it with you. 
                        <br><br>Before signing an agreement with the franchisor / ATM Operator, you must ask the below questions: -
                        <br><br>1.	Who is the owner of the equipment?
                        <br>2.	Who is responsible for any physical damage or theft of the equipment?
                        <br>3.	Who is accountable for Cash in ATM?

                            
                       <br><br><b>‚û§  Ideally, the accountability of the ATM Operator should be: </b>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Supply of Assets (ATM / UPS /VSAT)</li>
                            <li>Supply of Signage and Branding </li>
                            <li>Ownership of all the assets</li>
                            <li>The insurance of assets and cash</li>
                            <li>Supply of ATM fit currency</li>
                            <li>Managing sponsor bank</li>
                            <li>Cash Loading in ATM</li>
                            <li>Switching (Payment Processing)</li>
                            <li>24x7 Live Monitoring</li>
                            <li>24x7 Tech Support</li>
                            <li>First Level Maintenance </li>
                            <li>Second Level Maintenance</li>
                            <li>Preventive Maintenance</li>
                            <li>Providing VSAT Connectivity</li>
                            <li>Supply of Consumables</li>
                            <li>Part Replacements</li>
                           <li>Settlement & Reconciliation</li>
                           <li>Payment of Fee (Commission)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <b>‚û§  The responsibility of the Franchise owner should be:</b>
                         <br>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Identification of the location</li>
                            <li>Providing ready location with all interior</li>
                            <li>Providing stable power supply</li>
                            <li>The profitability of the business</li>
                            <li>Payment of Rent</li>
                            <li>Payment of Electricity bill</li>
                            <li>Ensure Site Cleanliness</li>
                          </ul>
                        One thing is clear that when you own a franchise, you own a business, and your core interest should be making a profit out of the same and ensure profitability.
                        <br><br>Many things needed to get an ATM installed, and make it running 24 x 7 for end-users. Definitely, ATM Operators are experts in their line of business, or they have vendors to do all those technical things. Hence, it is better not to get into technically of the ATM, e.g., installing, maintaining, cash loading in ATM. Better to focus on making the business profitable. For example, the ATM Operator asks you for loading cash in ATM, you must ask-
                        <br><br>What if there is a shortage of cash occurs in ATMs or any fake currency gets loaded?
                       <br><br> What is the guideline of the RBI regarding Cash handling and Custodianship?
